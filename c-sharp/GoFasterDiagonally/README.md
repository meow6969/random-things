# GoFasterDiagonally
stardew valley mod that makes u go faster diagonally  
basically in vanilla when u go diagonal ur speed is multiplied by 1/sqrt(2)  
this normalizes the speed so no matter what direction u go it will always be equal velocity  
  
this undoes that so when u go diagonally u go baseSpeed*sqrt(2)  
its super awesome!!
